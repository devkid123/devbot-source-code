This is the code for devbot, feel free to use it! Check the <a href="#Usage">usage section</a> for how to use the bot.

# Usage
First, create a discord application at <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications/">https://discord.com/developers/applications/</a>, then open it and go to the section named "Bot", then click create a bot, after it is done, click "Copy" button which is under the text called "Click to reveal token". then go to the last line of main.py script and replace the token "ODU5MzIwMTkzMDQ1MjMzNjc0.YNq-Sw.fhs_JiZbblJeXKdtwdn5CH5C1Cs" with the token you just copied. Now to start the bot, install python, then go to command prompt and type "pip install discord.py", after it gets installed, run "cd path/where/the/bot/is", then run "python dev bot.py" and the bot will be running.

now we want to add it to a server, so go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications/">https://discord.com/developers/applications/</a>, select your application, then copy the application id. go to <a href="https://scarsz.me/authorize">https://scarsz.me/authorize</a> and paste the application id. then add it to a server and enjoy :)
